                <p class="article-text">The United States is growing at an exceptional rate, with schools becoming increasingly diverse. However, this diversity does not always translate to educational equity. Many racial and ethnic minority students face systemic racism within the school system, leading to educational inequality and widening the achievement gap.</p>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">According to data from the KIDS COUNT® Data Center (2022), a significant percentage of students of color struggle to meet proficiency levels in reading. Among fourth graders nationwide, 84% of Black students, 82% of American Indian students, and 80% of Hispanic students did not read at a fourth-grade proficiency level. This opportunity gap is not just an academic issue—it reflects deeper inequities in access to resources, experienced teachers, and school funding.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">Beyond academic disparities, racial bias also influences how students are treated. Data from 2017-2018 highlights disproportionate discipline in schools. Black students were the most likely to face expulsion, with 49 out of every 10,000 students being expelled, compared to just 4 out of every 10,000 Asian students. This school-to-prison pipeline disproportionately affects students of color, pushing them out of educational environments and limiting their future opportunities.</p>

                <span class="article-subheader">Barriers Beyond the Classroom</span>
                <p class="article-text">School funding disparities and socioeconomic status play a crucial role in shaping students’ futures. Many low-income communities have underfunded schools that lack quality teachers, resources, and enrichment programs. As a result, students in these areas receive a lower-quality education, which contributes to higher dropout rates and fewer opportunities for social mobility.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">The financial burden on low-income families can also prevent students from accessing college. Without sufficient resources, many are forced to leave school early or attend underfunded Title I schools, where they may not receive the same quality of education as students in wealthier districts. In some cases, the lack of educational opportunities forces students into unstable or dangerous paths, further reinforcing cycles of poverty.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">Additionally, implicit bias in schools affects how students are perceived and treated. Research shows that teachers and administrators may unintentionally hold lower expectations for students of color, influencing academic outcomes and discipline rates. These biases contribute to the unequal treatment and limited opportunities experienced by marginalized students.</p>

                <span class="article-subheader">A Longstanding Fight for Equality</span>
                <p class="article-text">The fight against segregation and educational inequality has spanned centuries. From 1740 to 1964, various efforts aimed to combat racial discrimination in education, with one of the most significant milestones being Brown v. Board of Education (1954). This landmark Supreme Court case ruled that racial segregation in schools was unconstitutional, marking a pivotal moment in the push for desegregation and equal educational opportunities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">Despite legal advancements, resistance to desegregation persisted. Many did not want Black students attending predominantly white schools, leading to the establishment of alternative institutions. On February 25, 1837, Cheyney University of Pennsylvania became the nation's first Historically Black College and University (HBCU), providing higher education opportunities for Black students who were otherwise excluded from mainstream institutions.</p>

                <span class="article-subheader">The Path Forward</span>
                <p class="article-text">While progress has been made, educational inequality remains a pressing issue. Addressing these challenges requires systemic reform, equitable school funding, and policies that promote educational equity for all students, regardless of race or socioeconomic background. Without these changes, the achievement gap will persist, limiting opportunities for future generations.</p>

            <!-- <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">Another issue citizens are confused about is the deportation situation. There are plenty of reports of people seeing their family and friends get deported after they voted for Trump. In the CBS News article they said they thought Trump would “get rid of the bad hombres.” This shows how misinformed the general public is on society and policies. If these people understood what was going to happen to their loved ones, they would have never voted for Trump.</p>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">For many people, the American dream is becoming the ICE dream as they watch their family and friends get dragged away by ICE agents. When they cast their vote, they were essentially voting in favor of sending away their family and friends. People need to be better informed about policies, injustice, and society as a whole, either by doing their own research or by improving widespread media to better educate everyone.</p>
