                <p class="article-text">The rich and high class citizens don’t understand the lower classes, which make up the majority of the country. America is built around making the rich richer and the poor poorer. For example, employers will find any way possible to not pay their workers. Some methods they use are paying partial wages, giving unpaid overtime, and flat out failing to pay wages.</p>

                <span class="article-subheader">What this means</span>
                <p class="article-text">Doing this only hurts the employees, because they have to suffer because their boss wanted to save a few dollars, which likely will be next to nothing for them, but devastating for the victim. This is a social injustice because people are being punished for doing their job.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">It’s fair to receive a fair day’s pay after a fair day’s work, as this is what allows everyone to eat and sleep safely. Citizens (especially lower-class ones) already struggle to get by when receiving their full paychecks, so getting only part of it or none at all spells doom for them. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">Many people live on the streets using whatever money they can get just to eat for the week, and this becomes more widespread if people don’t get their money. Data also shows that this issue is most prominent in construction, food service, hotels, and home healthcare agencies, most of them being easy careers that lower class citizens will work. Employers not paying their workers is increasing poverty rates in the U.S. </p>

                <p class="article-text">Inflation is another social injustice that is a big issue in the U.S., especially recently. Prices of goods have been rapidly increasing, but wages have stayed the same. This means people have to pay more money for the same products.</p>

                <p class="article-text">For rich people, such as president Trump, this isn’t an issue (and it’s also why they’re in favor of his tariffs). Everyone else, however, only suffers as essential goods get more expensive.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">For example, egg prices are sky high right now, almost $1 per egg. If it were just a few items it wouldn’t be that much of an issue, but almost everything is really expensive. Eggs, milk, cheese, meat, all the essential food items are only getting more and more expensive. Other prices are rising too, such as the already very expensive cars.</p>

                <p class="article-text">If prices continue to rise without salaries also increasing, the average U.S. citizen will have a hard time living a comfortable, let alone stable, life in the United States</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">Misinformation/lack of information is another issue that is somewhat correlated to inflation. Most U.S. citizens don’t understand what tariffs do. Tariffs place a tax on imported goods, so importing countries increase their prices to make up for it. People don’t realize that tariffs only cause imported goods to be marked up to make up for lost money.</p>

            <!-- <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">Another issue citizens are confused about is the deportation situation. There are plenty of reports of people seeing their family and friends get deported after they voted for Trump. In the CBS News article they said they thought Trump would “get rid of the bad hombres.” This shows how misinformed the general public is on society and policies. If these people understood what was going to happen to their loved ones, they would have never voted for Trump.</p>

            <div class="article-text-wrapper">
                <p class="article-text">For many people, the American dream is becoming the ICE dream as they watch their family and friends get dragged away by ICE agents. When they cast their vote, they were essentially voting in favor of sending away their family and friends. People need to be better informed about policies, injustice, and society as a whole, either by doing their own research or by improving widespread media to better educate everyone.</p>
