                <p class="article-text">The lack of empathy has always been deeply connected to the world's greatest problems, with selfishness being one of the greatest triggers of fatalities, resulting in the unjust suffering of a part of society that lives off the false promises perpetrated by leaders and the privileged part of the world. The simple fact that life begs for a change is unfair. As members of the upper echelons of society, they should set an example, but no, they fill us with promises that will be broken, along with the hope of those who suffer day by day. There are many examples of this, below are some that denigrate our concept as a society and show the great injustice of this world perpetuated by humans, due to the lack of empathy:</p>

                <p class="article-text">The Kantō massacre was the result of social stigmas similar to those in Nazi Germany. In Kantō, a densely populated area of the Japanese capital of Tokyo, a large earthquake of 7.9 occurred. The earthquake would trigger a series of events that would raise tensions between Koreans and Japanese in Tokyo. Soon rumors would spread about the Korean population, who would take advantage of the chaos to steal, burn, kill Japanese and even stage a coup d'état.</p>

An example of the great hypocrisy of the great leaders was seen in the Paris Treaty, an agreement signed by the leaders of the world powers to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

The magnitude of this social injustice is such that it is almost not perceived by the world and the fear of leaders. Lack of empathy has caused the death of more than 85,000 women and girls around the world by 2023. The perpetrators had no empathy, and justice will never be done for them.  </p>
